So when the opportunity to collaborate with Bethlehem Haven on designing and sourcing the furnishings for its 1410 Fifth Ave. renovation project came along, it felt like the perfect fit, Catherine says.\n\nHer work with Bethlehem Haven has three goals: to provide each resident with a sense of self, equity and pride; to help them develop a sense of responsibility for how to take care of their environment; and to create a living space that's beautiful and peaceful. \n\n\"Taking care of one's environment is an extension of taking care of one's self,\" Catherine says. \"A lot of these women have had a major trauma in their lives. This is to help prepare them for a new life. Our designs are infused with love, empathy and a Frenchsational sense of fun.\"\n\nLearn more about the upcoming gala and how you can be involved in supporting the 1410 renovation: #LinkInBio \n\nWe see you, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build a strong foundation together.\n\n#BethlehemHaven #WeSeeYou #Community #Nonprofit #Homeless #EndHomelessness",

We cannot do this without your support. \n\nA $3,000 gift fully underwrites one room from design to decor. Rooms can be underwritten by individuals, companies, clubs, or groups of friends. \n\nYour generosity now will have an impact on women for years to come, and will be recognized with a plaque dedication at 1410 Fifth Avenue, as well as in the hearts of the staff and residents.\nWe see you.

At Bethlehem Haven, though, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found a mission that aligns with her values and desire to spread grace, peace and acceptance for all.\n\nAs the Medical Respite Supervisor, Jan leads an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, social services and guest services personnel. Her vision for Respite is to help people feel valued and respected, with a trauma-informed approach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis approach not only supports those experiencing homelessness, but it strengthens relationships with those who work alongside us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we see and hear from everyone involved, we do our best work. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes teamwork and collaborative models of care so strong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCongratulations to Jan who also recently was awarded the Marilyn Sullivan Award for her commitment to compassion, justice, advocacy and servant leadership!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goal is to make everyone feel welcome, like an invited guest. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something few experience on the streets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n#BethlehemHaven #WeSeeYou #Community #Nonprofit #Homeless #EndHomelessness #AwardWinner #JanCarlini #MedicalRespite",

He and local high school student, Moonyoung Hwang, held a miniature golf gathering at Pine Creek Mini Golf in Allison Park to support Bethlehem Haven.\n\nThey used the event as an opportunity to bring awareness of Bethlehem Haven and our mission and to raise funds to help support those we're privileged to serve. \n\nThey have raised more than $1,400 (and counting!) which will help to furnish one of the rooms in the 1410 Fifth Ave. renovation.\n\nThank you to everyone who contributed! We see you. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build a strong foundation together! \n\nIf you'd like to learn more, email minigolffundraiser@gmail.com or make a donation via the Bethlehem Haven website and include \"Mini Golf Fundraiser\" in the comments section. \n\nIf you're interested in sponsoring an event to support Bethlehem Haven, please contact Senior Manager of Development Kate Colligan: Kate.Colligan@bethlehemhaven.org or 412-944-1393.\n\n#BethlehemHaven #WeSeeYou #EndHomelessnness #Fundraiser #AllisonPark",

Bethlehem Haven partners with local community health systems and managed care organizations (MCO).\n\nWe believe in meeting people where they are. We see you.

She also strives to use food as a way to build community.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of them don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to restaurants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tammy, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been with Bethlehem Haven since 2012. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here and eating they feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out at an event. They feel comfortable and relaxed. It makes them feel wanted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome of the most requested dishes that Tammy makes are hot beans, cornbread and chicken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey really like the holidays when I cook for them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tammy says.\n\nIn addition to preparing meals, Tammy works with others to plan the menu for three Bethlehem Haven programs across two locations. Bethlehem Haven contracts the service provider Community Kitchen to cook some of the meals and coordinates with volunteers to schedule days when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide breakfast, lunch or dinner. \n\nVolunteers can be individuals or organizations and work with Tammy to plan the details for dropping off food or preparing it on site. The residents like the home-cooked and diverse meals that are shared with them.\n\nFor those who volunteer to prepare a meal on site, Tammy reminds them to strive to meet the people who Bethlehem Haven serves where they are.\n\nIt takes a lot of planning and attention to detail to keep everyone fed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expensive. On average, it costs more than $155,000 per year. Bethlehem Haven seeks funding to cover these costs and is grateful to the donors and volunteers who know that food plays a role in bringing stability and trust to those who have been without it for too long. \n\nFor Tammy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all worth it. Her favorite part of her job is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe smiles of the women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to sponsor a meal for Bethlehem Haven, please contact info@bethlehemhaven.org to coordinate.\n\n#BethlehemHaven #WeSeeYou #Community #Nonprofit #Homeless #SafeAtHome #EndHomelessness",

They discussed how the transition could be difficult for some residents who felt safe in their home and now are adapting to a different neighborhood. \n\nWith this in mind, the students made this a project during Catholic Schools Week and created cards with a variety of messages to inspire women who may feel alone or are facing troubles we may not know about because everyone deserves love and support.\n\nConnect with us #LinkInBio \n\n#BethlehemHaven #WeSeeYou #Community #Nonprofit #Homeless #SafeAtHome #EndHomelessness",

These are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.\n\nSocial determinants of health have a major impact on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, well-being, and quality of life. Examples of SDOH include:\n\n1. Safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods\n2. Racism, discrimination, and violence\n3. Education, job opportunities, and income\n4. Access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities\n5. Polluted air and water\n6. Language and literacy skills\n\nLearn how Bethlehem Haven is working to end the cycle of homelessness and how you can get involved to support our neighbors in need with the #LinkInBio \n\n#BethlehemHaven #WeSeeYou #Community #Nonprofit #Homeless #SafeAtHome #EndHomelessness #AHN #SocialDeterminants #SafeHousing \n@ahntoday",

It serves individuals and provides a safe recuperative environment, as well as wrap-around supportive services such as a full-time housing advocate. \n\nFolks can also  receive physical therapy, occupational therapy, wound care, and infusion antibiotics. \n\nWe are also taking softer admissions:  diabetes management, post-cardiac care. Respite is also very different from a hospital. At the hospital folks often feel isolated and \u00e2\u0080\u009cunseen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\nOften when people come to us from the hospital, they have minimal personal belongings, including clothing and personal care items.

Together we can work on identifying those experiences and create a customized plan to the specific needs of each individual. From acute homelessness through the continuum to independent housing, our programs offer support to the whole person (also known as holistic support).\n\nHomelessness is not a new public health crisis. Many regions across the country,  organizations, advocacy groups and political entities refer to this as a new public health crisis, but it's not. As demonstrated by more than 40 years of service to the community, Bethlehem Haven has been full every single night since opening its doors. \n\nWe see you.
